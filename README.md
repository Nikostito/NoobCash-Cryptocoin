# NoobCash-Cryptocoin

A python 3 implementation fo a POW CryptoCoin made for a project for the Lesson "Distributed Systems" for the ECE School in NTUA.

The program makes a Coin which you can mine and you get rewarded for its mined block. 
You can create seperate miners, send and receive coins to your address and all from a Web-UI built with VueJS.
Hope anyone can find it useful for their own research!
